A pytest plugin that reports test results to the BeakerLib framework.

pytest: http://pytest.org/latest/
BeakerLib: https://fedorahosted.org/beakerlib/

Once installed, this plugin can be activated via the --with-beakerlib ooption.
This requires a BeakerLib session (i.e. rlJournalStart should have been run,
so that $BEAKERLIB is set)


Operation

A Bash process is run on the side, and BeakerLib commands (rlPhaseStart,
rlPhaseEnd, rlPass, rlFail, ...) are fed to it.
This is not very elegant, but since BeakerLib commands are Bash functions,
there is no way around running Bash.


Integration

Other plugins may integrate with this using pytest's
config.pluginmanager.getplugin('BeakerLibPlugin'). If this is None,
BeakerLib integration is not active, otherwise the result's
run_beakerlib_command method can be used to run additional commands.
